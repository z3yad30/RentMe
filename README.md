# RentMe
A small SQL project shows my skills
# RentMeDB 🚗

This is a basic database project built for practicing SQL and understanding how to model a simple car rental system. It includes tables for Customers, Cars, Employees, Reservations, and Payments — along with basic role-based access control setup.

⚙️ **Key Features:**
- Customer and car data management
- Reservation tracking
- Payment logging
- Role-based access (Owner, Manager, Staff)
- Sample data + permission configuration

📁 **What's Inside:**
- `CREATE TABLE` statements
- `INSERT` sample data
- Simple role creation & permission control
- Transaction example with error handling
- SQL Server syntax

📝 **Note:**
This is not a full-scale production project — it's just a learning experiment to get more familiar with database design and SQL scripting using Microsoft SQL Server.
